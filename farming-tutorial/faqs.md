# FAQs

### Is the DApp totally based on blockchain?

Yes, the DApp is totally blockchain-based, staying true to the nature of DApps and only utilizes solidity-based contracts that directly communicate with the BSC chain.

### Do I need BNB to play the game?

Yes, you may need some BNB as the gas fee for performing almost any task that creates changes to the blockchain.

### Do I need Metamask to play?

Metamask is the only type of wallet we have integrated our DApp with due to its popularity. We may provide multi-wallet support in future.

### Why do transactions and data fetching feel slow?

Sometimes, blockchains may get congested due to overload that creates a backlog and slows down transactions. In case the data does not load after a minute or two, try refreshing the page or checking your internet connection for problems at your end. Fetching data from the blockchain can become a hassle when the user has a weak internet connection.

### Why do some actions require two transactions while others require just one?

This depends on the nature of the task to be performed. Two transactions are required when there is an expenditure of PINE tokens involved. The first transaction approves the expenditure of the PINE token from a different contract and the subsequent transaciton spends the tokens to bring about the necessary changes in the DApp.

### "This transaction is expected to fail", showing up on Metamask.

![Metamask Error](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png>)

This error can be caused by internal changes in the contract hence it is **strongly** advised not to continue executing the transaction as it would fail and cost significantly to the user. A quick solution may be to refresh the page and retry performing the task. If it is not solved, please contact the admin regarding your issue with the details of the transaction being performed.
