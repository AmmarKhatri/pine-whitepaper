## What should I do after purchasing a farm?

After purchasing a farm, the following options can be observed:

A basic farm that is purchased from the store is referred to as a 5 x 5 farm which is the cheapest base level farm one can purchase. Each farm is provided with four options:

* **Plant** button **** allows you to plant a nut that acts as a seed, consuming one nut from your inventory and displaying a tree on your farm in one block.
* **Harvest** button will remove a tree if there is/are any on the farm and add a tree on your inventory where it can be later be extracted.
* **Upgrade** button would increase a layer on your farm from both the x and y dimensions. Assuming a 5 x 5 farm costs 100,000 PINE tokens in the store, the cost of upgrading is calculated by the addition of new blocks added after each subsequent upgrade. In a 5 x 5 farm, there are 25 blocks, hence each block costs 100,000 / 25 = 4,000 PINE. Upgrading from a 5 x 5 (25 blocks) to 6 x 6 (36 blocks) farm has an increment of 11 blocks, accumulating the total cost of the upgrade to 44,000 PINE. Farms can be upgraded to a maximum of 10 x 10.
* **Sell** button creates a listing of the farm along with the number of trees that it contains to be listed on the community market.
