# Store Section

This section defines how the assets come into supply in the pine farming economy. Each asset purchased(including farms) come into being from the store and can either be consumed or traded on the community market.

### The Creator's Store

![Store Section](<../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png>)

A player can increment or decrement the quantity of individual assets he wants to purchase at a given time. The total is calculated in PINE tokens. The buy button is only enabled when the total is greater than 0.

The tip is only applicable as the transaction costs remain to be constant whether a player buys just one asset or buys a huge quantity. It would be beneficial for him to reduce his cost only if buys in bulk.
