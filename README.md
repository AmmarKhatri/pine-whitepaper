# Pine Project

## An investment tool for the masses

Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile and over a certain period of time, the prices can move up or down sharply which makes it ineligible to trade for the faint-hearted.&#x20;

Investing in cryptocurrencies results in huge losses for new and old investors alike. Long-term investors and traders subsequently lose during market volatility. Such investors and traders need a solution that saves them from this pain.

### Our aims

With PINE tokens, our aim is to enable investors and traders to earn huge profits in the long run by investing in one single coin rather than in multiple cryptocurrencies and NFTs. Pine uses the Binance Smart Chain protocol for peer-to-peer transactions. All PINE transactions will be recorded to the Binance Smart Chain to ensure immutability and transparency.

### Fundamentals: Dive a little deeper

Money raised through the sale of PINE tokens will be invested in cryptocurrencies, ICOs, Farming, Pooling, Staking, and NFTs.&#x20;

It is observed that an individual investor cannot invest in cryptocurrencies, ICOs, Farming, Pooling, Staking, and NFTs at the same time for the best returns.&#x20;

Our team has seven years of cryptocurrencies, 30 years of equities research, and investment experience enabling us to make strategic investments and work for exceptional gains.
